# RVCE_Internship_Management_System

RVCE Internship Management System aims at providing the compatibility to simplify
the process of internships/placement for students.This system consists of a student login,
company login and an admin login. This is beneficial for college students, various companies
visiting the campus for recruitment and even the college placement officer. The software
system allows the students to create their profiles and upload all their details including their
marks onto the system. The admin can check each student's details and can remove faculty
accounts. The system also consists of a company login where various companies visiting the
college can view a list of students in that college and also their respective resumes. The
software system allows students to view a list of companies who have posted for vacancy.
The admin has overall rights over the system and can moderate and delete any details not
pertaining to college placement rules.<br/>
